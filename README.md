## 👋 Hello There

My name is James, and I am a freelancing **Front End Developer**, with experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, JQuery, discord.js, and SQL.

I am exceptionally passionate about utilizing my creativity in designing; developing a professional website for my clients. I am regularly looking for feedback to assist me in strengthening my skills.

Experience with JavaScript, Node.js, and discord.js has helped me develop multiple bots on a communication platform called [Discord](https://discord.com/). The bots that I have created are **Game-Bug Bot**, **BetterFilter**, and **Badge Info**.

At the moment, I am trying to find clients so I would be able to gain more work experience to add it to my CV.
